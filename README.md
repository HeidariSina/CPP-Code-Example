## About the Repository

The goal of this repository is to provide an easy-to-navigate collection of C++ code examples that demonstrate key concepts and algorithms in C++. This includes:
- Basic syntax and data structures
- Object-oriented programming
- Algorithms and problem-solving techniques
- Advanced topics such as templates, memory management, and design patterns.

Each example is written with clear and concise comments, making it easy to follow along and understand the purpose of the code.

## Prerequisites

To run the examples provided in this repository, you need the following:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming language
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, Code::Blocks)

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into several folders to make it easier to find specific examples. Here's a brief overview:

```plaintext
/basics/              -> Simple examples covering C++ basics (loops, conditions, etc.)
/data_structures/     -> Implementations of common data structures (linked lists, trees, etc.)
/algorithms/          -> Examples of algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.)
/object_oriented/     -> Object-Oriented Programming concepts (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)
/advanced/            -> Advanced C++ concepts (templates, smart pointers, etc.)
```

## Building and Running

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HeidariSina/CPP-Code-Example.git
cd CPP-Code-Example
```

2. Navigate to specific example directory:
```bash
